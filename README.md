# Simple Vanilla JS Todo List

This is a simple, responsive Todo list application built from scratch (as "Scratch JS Todo list" in the title suggests) using plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. The project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and using `localStorage` for data persistence.

## Features

* **Add Tasks:** Quickly add new tasks using the input field.
* **Complete Tasks:** Mark tasks as complete by clicking the checkmark. This toggles a `done` class which adds a line-through style.
* **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from the list permanently.
* **Data Persistence:** All tasks are saved to the browser's `localStorage`. Your todo list will be waiting for you even after you close or refresh the page.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** Includes a theme switcher that toggles between a light and dark theme. This preference is also saved in `localStorage`.
* **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive and works on mobile devices.
* **Empty State:** A friendly message and icon are displayed when the todo list is empty.

## Technologies Used

* **HTML5**
* **CSS3** (with CSS Variables for theming)
* **Vanilla JavaScript** (for all functionality, including DOM manipulation and event listeners)
* **Font Awesome** (for icons)
